        <p><span class="introText">The Louisiana Constitution</span>, as amended in 1936 by Article XIV, Section 22A, Act 139,  authorized the City of New Orleans to create the Vieux Carré Commission, whose  purpose is the preservation of buildings within the French Quarter deemed to  have architectural and historic value. In 1938, under the Works Progress  Administration, the Historic American Buildings Survey undertook a study of a  few city blocks within the Vieux Carré, but a comprehensive survey of the  Quarter was not begun until 1960. In that year, the Louisiana Landmarks Society  underwrote the cost of a pilot study of a single city block: square 63, bounded  by Royal, Conti, Bourbon, and St. Louis streets. The Louisiana Landmarks  Society and the Vieux Carré Commission were so pleased with the result that  they went in search of grant funds to undertake such a study for the entire  Vieux Carré. The Edward G. Schlieder Educational Foundation agreed to fund the  project through the Tulane University School of Architecture.</p>
<p>John W. Lawrence, then dean of the Tulane University School  of Architecture, was selected to head an advisory board of scholars and civic  leaders, whose job it would be to direct the study. Serving on the board with  Lawrence were collector Leonard V. Huber, preservation architect Richard Koch,  collector L. Kemper Williams, restoration architect Samuel Wilson Jr., artist  Boyd Cruise, professor of architecture Bernard Lemann, and architecture  historian Edith Long.&nbsp; Under their  guidance, work commenced on April 1, 1961, on what has become known as the  Vieux Carré Survey.</p>
<p> Staff employed to work on the survey photographed or copied  historic maps, major site plans, and old drawings, engravings, sketches, and  paintings. They searched newspapers and early travel accounts for information  on buildings and sites within the Quarter. Photographer Dan Leyrer was hired to  make a photographic record of every street façade and lot, including those  without buildings. Architect John Bohlke created a series of front-elevation  drawings of each block, in order to show spatial and design relationships among  buildings. Tulane students assisted in compiling an ownership record of the  land and buildings. Starting with the then-current owner, property was traced  back until no further transactions could be located, or until the chains became  too difficult to trace in the original Spanish and French records. The chains  of title became the heart of the survey, supporting all the other documentation  to form a history of the land as well as modifications made to the buildings on  it.</p>
<p> The work on the Vieux Carré Survey, as overseen by the  initial advisory board, officially ceased on June 1, 1966. Only eighty-eight of  the 120 city squares had been researched. The survey was microfilmed, and copies  of that microfilm were placed with Tulane University’s Howard Tilton Memorial  Library, the Schlieder Educational Foundation, the Library of Congress, and the  Vieux Carré Commission, which later turned its copy over to the Louisiana  Division of the New Orleans Public Library. The survey itself would remain in  the Vieux Carré with the collection of General L. Kemper Williams. </p>
<p> After the advisory board was disbanded, in October of 1966,  The Historic New Orleans Collection continued to supplement the survey, and in  1977 funding was received from architect Collins Diboll to complete the survey.  A new review committee was established under the direction of Humberto  Rodriguez-Camilloni, professor of historic preservation at Tulane. Serving with  Rodriguez-Camilloni were Bernard Lemann, Boyd Cruise, Samuel Wilson Jr.,  Stanton Frazar, and Dode Platou. Tulane students researched chains of title,  produced photographs, and compiled supplementary materials pertaining to  selected lots and squares. In 1979 The Historic New Orleans Collection, along  with Collins Diboll, financed a permanent workforce to complete the survey.  Staff were hired to research chains of title, and photographer Jerry Toler was  employed to photograph each building and site in the Vieux Carré. By the end of  1980, all the squares had been fully researched and updated. </p>
<p> In 2000 the Systems Department of The Collection conducted  an extensive analysis of the Vieux Carré Survey and designed a database to  accommodate the information with the goal of digitizing the survey. As a paper  document without external indices, much of the information within the survey is  difficult to access or analyze, as it can be accessed only following the  survey’s physical arrangement: by municipal address. Digitizing the survey would  allow access and analysis by various other data elements, such as owners’  names. To assist in the financing of the digitization of the Vieux Carré  Survey, The Collection turned to the Collins C. Diboll Foundation, which  graciously granted monies to convert the survey into electronic format,  digitize its images, and create a searchable, web-based interface for the data  and images. In 2010 The Historic New Orleans Collection hired photographer John  Watson Riley to update the visual record of the properties of the Quarter. We  are pleased to make the Collins C.  Diboll Vieux Carré Digital Survey<strong> </strong>available  to the world through the internet. The Historic New Orleans Collection remains  committed to maintaining the survey and has staff currently working to update  the chains of title.</p>
